# My LeetCode Collections

*Note: this repo doesn't follow code style conventions because leet code requires specific names for functions, for example, countBits, instead of count_bits.*

## Origin

This is my LeetCode project which I started at the end of 2016. I continued for quite a while, stopped in the mid of 2018, hibernated for quite a long time, then rebooted at the end of 2020 but didn't keep it going for a long time

## Dir Structure

Initially, I put every problem as a single file in the above folders:

- folder `0`: questions 0-99
- folder `1`: questions 1-199
- folder `2`: questions 2-299
- ...

## Rework

In the spring of 2021, I decided to rework it a bit, mainly focusing on the medium difficulty, top interviewed ones.

I didn't plan to rework ALL of those medium difficulty ones, though. 

Each of the reworked new solutions has its own single commit, with comments at least, possibly a readme as well, and put under specific folders with the problem name.

## Search

Search in this repo (see results in both code, and commits) to find a specific topic or algorithm. For example, if you want to see problems related to "backtrack":
